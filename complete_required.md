PART 3 ‚Äî AD INTEGRATION (How it works + SDK snippets)

Principles

Admin adds ad networks and multiple ad units per network in Admin ‚Üí Ads Management.

Each placement (Tap, Spin, Game, Task) has a mapped ad unit (or fallback chain).

Client calls /api/get_ads?placement=tap to get which network + ad unit to show.

Client/ads.js shows ad using the network SDK snippet associated with the returned ad unit.

Server must log ad events: impression, click, complete, reward grant.



---

1) Adexium ‚Äî Integration & Example

Admin fields:

Toggle ON/OFF

Widget ID(s) per ad format (interstitial, rewarded, banner)

Example admin entry names: Tap Interstitial, Tap Rewarded, Banner Home


SDK snippet to place in <head>

<!-- Adexium -->
<script src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js?56"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.tgads.space/assets/js/adexium-widget.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // Example: Interstitial
  const adexiumWidget = new AdexiumWidget({
    wid: 'ef364bbc-e2b8-434c-8b52-c735de561dc7', // admin-provided widget id
    adFormat: 'interstitial'
  });
  // Auto mode will decide when to show as per SDK
  adexiumWidget.autoMode();
  
  // Example: Show manually
  // adexiumWidget.show();
});
</script>

Admin must create ad unit records like:

name: Tap Interstitial ‚Üí widget id: ef364bbc-e2b8-434c-8b52-c735de561dc7 ‚Üí format: interstitial



---

2) Monetag ‚Äî Integration & Example

Admin fields:

Toggle ON/OFF

SDK ID / Zone ID (e.g., 10055887)

Per ad format config: rewarded/interstitial/inApp settings


SDK snippet to place in <head>

<!-- Monetag -->
<script src="//libtl.com/sdk.js" data-zone="10055887" data-sdk="show_10055887"></script>

Usage examples (client-side JS):

// Rewarded interstitial example:
show_10055887().then(() => {
  // Reward callback: grant reward here on successful complete
  grantUserReward();
});

// In-App Interstitial with advanced settings:
show_10055887({
  type: 'inApp',
  inAppSettings: {
    frequency: 2,       // show automatically 2 ads within time window
    capping: 0.1,       // 0.1 hours = 6 minutes
    interval: 30,       // 30 sec between ads
    timeout: 5,         // delay 5 sec before first show
    everyPage: false    // session preserved between pages
  }
});

Admin note: store SDK ID 10055887 and allow per-placement ad unit creation.


---

3) Adsgram ‚Äî Integration & Example

Admin fields:

Toggle ON/OFF

Block IDs for each format (reward block, interstitial block, task ad block)

Adsgram is Telegram-native ‚Äî ensure block IDs map to placements


Ad units examples provided by you:

Task ad unit: task-16416

Interstitial ad unit: int-16415

Reward ad unit: 16414


Admin mapping example:

Task Ads ‚Üí adsgram block task-16416

Game Pre-roll ‚Üí adsgram int-16415

Spin Reward ‚Üí adsgram 16414


Client usage:

/api/get_ads?placement=task ‚Üí returns {network: 'adsgram', unitId: 'task-16416'}

client calls Adsgram SDK or Adsgram code to show block task-16416 (SDK snippet will depend on Adsgram docs / Telegram environment).



---

4) Richads ‚Äî Integration & Example

Admin fields:

Toggle ON/OFF

Publisher ID, App ID

Ad unit IDs for different styles


SDK snippet to place in <head>

<!-- Richads -->
<script src="https://richinfo.co/richpartners/telegram/js/tg-ob.js"></script>
<script>
  window.TelegramAdsController = new TelegramAdsController();
  window.TelegramAdsController.initialize({
    pubId: "820238",
    appId: "4130"
  });
</script>

Ad unit examples you provided:

#375144 ‚Äî Telegram Interstitial video

#375143 ‚Äî Telegram Interstitial banner

#375141 ‚Äî Telegram Push-style

#375142 ‚Äî Telegram Embedded banner


Admin mapping example:

Tap ads ‚Üí Richads #375144 (if chosen)

Banner home ‚Üí Richads #375142



---

Example: /api/get_ads Flow (server ‚Üí client)

1. Client requests: GET /api/get_ads?placement=tap


2. Server reads admin mapping (placement ‚Üí ad_unit ‚Üí network) and fallback chain.


3. Server responds:



{
  "placement": "tap",
  "network": "adexium",
  "ad_unit": {
    "id": "ef364bbc-e2b8-434c-8b52-c735de561dc7",
    "type": "interstitial",
    "meta": {}
  },
  "fallback": [
    {"network":"monetag","ad_unit":{"id":"10055887","type":"rewarded"}},
    {"network":"adsgram","ad_unit":{"id":"task-16416","type":"task"}}
  ]
}

4. Client reads network and uses the correct SDK snippet to show the ad. On success/completion the client calls /api/report_ad_event with placement, event=complete, user_id, ad_unit.
