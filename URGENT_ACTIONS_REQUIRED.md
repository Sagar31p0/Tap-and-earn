```

### ? How to Fix (Takes 2 minutes):

4. **Update App URL**
   - Click Edit on the platform
   - Find "App URL" field
   - Change it to: `https://go.teraboxurll.in`

## ?? What Has Been Fixed

### ? 1. Tap Reward Settings
- **Before**: Always showed +5 coins (hardcoded)
- **After**: Uses the value from Admin Panel ? Settings ? Coins Per Tap
- **Test**: Change the setting and tap the coin - it will show the correct amount

### ? 2. Monetag Ad Loop
- **Before**: Ads kept loading repeatedly until app minimized
- **After**: Shows ONE ad, completes properly, then allows tapping again
- **How**: Changed to single-shot mode with proper state management

### ? 3. Adsgram Error Messages
- **Before**: Generic error messages
- **After**: Detailed instructions showing exactly how to fix configuration issues
- **Bonus**: Added platform URL validation and helpful error messages

### ? 4. Task Ads (Channel/Bot Promotion)
- **Understanding**: This is an Adsgram feature, not a bot feature
- **How it works**: When you create "Task" type ads in Adsgram, they automatically show channel/bot info
- **Guide**: See `ADSGRAM_TASK_ADS_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions
