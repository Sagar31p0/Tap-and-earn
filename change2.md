Bot Issues & Feature Requests

1. Tap Section:

The “Rich Ads” ad is appearing — add an option in the Admin Panel to change the ad network for this section.

Also, add a Tap Ad Frequency control in the Admin Panel where I can set how often the ad should appear.

Once the frequency is set (e.g., every 3 taps), the ad must appear strictly as per that setting (forced behavior).




2. Spin Section:

The Spin Block is currently not visible in the bot — please check and fix this issue.

Also, add an option in the Admin Panel to change the ad network for the Spin section.



3. Wallet Section:

Currently, users can only select wallet details — please add an option to manually enter wallet details as well.

Admin Panel Improvements

1. In the Ads Management section:

Add a “Check Ad Status” or “Test Ad” option to verify whether the ads are working correctly.

Implement a system to automatically check and display ad status across all bot functions (e.g., Tap, Spin, Wallet) — showing whether each ad is active, working, or failed.
