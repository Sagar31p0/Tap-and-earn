Telegram Bot Issues & Fix Requirements

1. Start Command (/start):

The /start command is not responding.

Create a professional welcome/start message with inline buttons (e.g., “🎯 Tap & Earn”, “🎡 Spin”, “💰 Wallet”, “⚙️ Help”).

Ensure the start message loads instantly when a new user starts or restarts the bot.



2. Spin Section:

The spin blocks are not visible inside the Spin tab.

When a user tries to spin, it shows: “⚠️ Spin feature coming soon!” — please fix this issue so the spin feature works correctly.

Verify that the spin logic, rewards, and limits are connected to the database properly.

Screenshot attached for reference.



3. Wallet Section:

Currently, users can select withdrawal amount and method, but they cannot fill details (like UPI ID, wallet address, etc.).

Add a feature to manually enter withdrawal details.

Include options for Crypto Coin and Network selection (e.g., USDT - TRC20 / ERC20, Bitcoin, Ethereum).



4. Ad Network Issue:

Only RichAds ads are being shown — no other ad network is displaying ads.

However, in the Admin Panel, it shows all ad networks as “working.”

Please check the ad integration logic and ensure other ad networks (like adsgram, manetag, adexium etc.) are also visible in rotation or as configured.



5. Database Update:

The updated database file (attached) contains the new ad units and settings.

Please verify that all new fields (like ad units, frequency, and network IDs) are correctly mapped and functional.
