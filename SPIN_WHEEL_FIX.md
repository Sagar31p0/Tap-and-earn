# Spin Wheel Blocks Display - Fix Applied âœ…

## Problem
The spin wheel canvas was empty - no blocks were visible even though the wheel functionality was working in the backend.

## Root Cause
- HTML canvas element existed but had no drawing code
- API wasn't returning block configuration for display
- JavaScript had no function to render the wheel

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Enhancement (`api/spin.php`)
```php
// Added block data to GET response (line 62-65)
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT block_label, reward_value, probability FROM spin_config WHERE is_active = 1 ORDER BY sort_order");
$stmt->execute();
$blocks = $stmt->fetchAll();
// Returns: blocks array with all active spin configurations
```

### 2. JavaScript Wheel Rendering (`js/app.js`)

Added three key components:

**A. Variables (lines 827-829)**
```javascript
let spinBlocks = [];      // Stores block data
let wheelCanvas = null;   // Canvas element
let wheelCtx = null;      // Canvas 2D context
```

**B. Data Loading (lines 837-845)**
```javascript
if (data.blocks && data.blocks.length > 0) {
    spinBlocks = data.blocks;
    drawSpinWheel();  // Draw immediately
}
```

**C. Drawing Function (lines 854-941)**
- Creates colorful pie chart with 8 segments
- Each segment has distinct color from palette
- Rotates and draws text labels on each segment
- Adds borders, shadows, and center circle
- Console logging for debugging

**D. Navigation Handler (line 281)**
- Redraws wheel when user navigates to spin screen
- 100ms delay ensures canvas is visible

## Visual Result

The wheel now displays:
- ðŸ”´ Red segment: "10" (10 coins)
- ðŸ”µ Cyan segment: "20" (20 coins)  
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow segment: "50" (50 coins)
- ðŸŸ¢ Mint segment: "100" (100 coins)
- ðŸ”´ Pink segment: "200" (200 coins)
- ðŸŸ£ Purple segment: "500" (500 coins)
- ðŸŸ¢ Light green segment: "1000" (1000 coins)
- ðŸŒ¸ Rose segment: "JACKPOT" (5000 coins)

## Testing Steps

1. **Open App**: Load the Telegram Mini App
2. **Navigate to Spin**: Click "Spin" in bottom navigation
3. **Verify Visual**: 
   - âœ… Colorful wheel with 8 segments visible
   - âœ… Clear labels on each segment
   - âœ… White borders between segments
   - âœ… Center circle with gradient
4. **Check Console**: Look for "âœ… Spin wheel successfully drawn with 8 blocks"
5. **Test Spin**: Click "SPIN NOW" button and verify functionality

## Files Modified

1. **api/spin.php** (Line 62-65)
   - Added query to fetch active blocks
   - Added `blocks` field to response

2. **js/app.js** (Multiple sections)
   - Lines 827-829: Added global variables
   - Lines 837-845: Added block loading logic
   - Lines 854-941: Added complete `drawSpinWheel()` function
   - Line 281: Added redraw on navigation

## Debug Information

Console messages you should see:
```
Drawing wheel with 8 blocks: 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, JACKPOT
âœ… Spin wheel successfully drawn with 8 blocks
```

If blocks don't appear:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify database has spin_config entries
- Ensure canvas element exists in DOM
- Check that blocks are returned from API

## Technical Details

**Canvas Specifications:**
- Size: 350x350 pixels
- Center: (175, 175)
- Radius: 165 pixels (with 10px padding)
- Text: Bold 20px Arial with shadow

**Color Palette:**
```javascript
['#FF6B6B', '#4ECDC4', '#FFD93D', '#95E1D3',
 '#F38181', '#6C5CE7', '#A8E6CF', '#FF8B94']
```

**Rotation Logic:**
- Each block: 360Â° / 8 = 45Â° arc
- Start angle: -90Â° (top of circle)
- Text positioned at 65% of radius

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The spin wheel blocks are now fully visible and functional!
