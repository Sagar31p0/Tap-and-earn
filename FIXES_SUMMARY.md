## Issue 1: Tap Feature - Force Ad After N Taps ✅

**Problem:** After 7 taps (or admin-configured number), ad should appear but tapping continues and ad doesn't show.

**Solution:**
- Added `isTappingBlocked` variable to control tap blocking
- Modified `sendTaps()` function to:
  - Block tapping when `show_ad` is true
  - Show visual feedback (opacity and cursor changes)
  - Only re-enable tapping after ad completes
  - Display success notification after ad completion

**Files Changed:** `js/app.js`

## Issue 2: Spin Wheel Blocks Not Displaying ✅

**Problem:** Spin wheel blocks are not visible on the canvas - the wheel appears empty.

**Root Cause:** 
- The HTML canvas element existed, but there was no JavaScript code to draw the wheel blocks
- The API was not returning the block configuration for display
- No visual representation of spin blocks on the wheel

**Solution:**
1. **API Enhancement** (`api/spin.php`):
   - Modified GET endpoint to fetch and return all active spin blocks
   - Returns block_label, reward_value, and probability for each block
   
2. **Wheel Drawing** (`js/app.js`):
   - Added `drawSpinWheel()` function to render wheel on canvas
   - Created colorful segments for each block (8 vibrant colors)
   - Added block labels with proper text rotation and styling
   - Added text shadows for better readability
   - Added gradient center circle for visual appeal
   
3. **Data Flow**:
   - `checkSpinAvailability()` now fetches blocks from API
   - Stores blocks in `spinBlocks` array
   - Automatically draws wheel when blocks are loaded
   - Redraws wheel when navigating to spin screen
   
4. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - 8 distinct colors for different reward blocks
   - White borders between segments
   - Bold, shadowed text labels
   - Responsive canvas sizing
   - Console logging for debugging

**Files Changed:** 
- `api/spin.php` - Added blocks data to API response
- `js/app.js` - Added wheel drawing and rendering logic

**Visual Result:**
- Colorful spinning wheel with all blocks visible
- Clear labels showing reward amounts (10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, JACKPOT)
- Professional appearance with proper styling

## Issue 3: Bot /start Message ✅

**Problem:** No message appears when using /start command even after webhook is set.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout bot.php:
  - Log all incoming updates
  - Validate JSON updates
  - Log message sending attempts
  - Log Telegram API responses
- Improved `sendTelegramRequest()` function:
  - Better error handling
  - Detailed error logging
  - Return proper error messages
- Added validation for chat_id and update data

**Files Changed:** `bot.php`

**Additional Steps Required:**
1. Ensure BOT_TOKEN is correctly set in `config.php`
2. Set webhook using: `https://yourdomain.com/webhook.php?action=set`
3. Check error logs at `/workspace/error.log` for any issues

## Issue 4: Tasks - Ad Not Appearing After Verification ✅

**Problem:** Ad should appear after task verification but it doesn't.

**Solution:**
- Modified `verifyTask()` function to show ad after verification
- Ad shows before rewarding coins and refreshing task list
- Placement type: 'task_verify'

**Files Changed:** `js/app.js`

## Issue 5: Wallet Payment Details Form ✅

**Problem:** No option to fill in payment details in wallet section.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced payment method selection handling:
  - Added helper text when no method is selected
  - Improved field rendering for all payment methods
  - Added fallback for methods without predefined fields
  - Added extensive console logging for debugging
- Improved error handling for missing DOM elements
- Enhanced Crypto payment method with:
  - Coin selection
  - Network selection (TRC20, ERC20, BEP20, etc.)
  - Wallet address input
  - Memo/Tag field
- Manual entry option already exists with:
  - Custom method name
  - Account details textarea
  - Additional information field

**Files Changed:** `js/app.js`

## Debug Logs

All debug information is now logged to:
- Browser console (for frontend issues)
- `/workspace/error.log` (for backend/bot issues)

Use these logs to diagnose any remaining issues.

## Configuration Check

Before testing, verify these settings in `config.php`:
```php
define('BOT_TOKEN', 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'); // Must be set
define('BOT_USERNAME', '@kuchpvildybot');
define('BASE_URL', 'https://reqa.antipiracyforce.org/test');
```

And verify database connection:
```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'u988479389_tery');
define('DB_USER', 'u988479389_tery');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_password_here'); // Must be set
```
