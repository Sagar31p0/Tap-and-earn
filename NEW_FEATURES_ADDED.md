## Notes & Recommendations 📝

### For Production:
1. **Telegram Bot Integration**: The broadcast feature logs messages but doesn't actually send them. You need to integrate Telegram Bot API to send messages.
2. **Ad Network Credentials**: Add your real widget IDs, zone IDs in the ad management panel.
3. **Test All Flows**: Test the complete user flow for each feature.
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check `/workspace/error.log` for any PHP errors.
5. **Database Backup**: Always backup your database before making changes.

### Security:
- ✅ SQL injection protection (PDO prepared statements)
- ✅ XSS protection (htmlspecialchars)
- ✅ .htaccess rules to protect sensitive files
- ✅ Session-based admin authentication
- ✅ Input validation on all forms

### Performance:
- ✅ Batched API calls in frontend
- ✅ Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- ✅ GZIP compression enabled
- ✅ Static file caching configured

## Support & Troubleshooting 🆘

### If Mini App Shows "Loading..." Forever:
1. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible: `https://reqa.antipiracyforce.org/test/api/auth.php`
3. Check PHP error logs on server
4. Ensure database connection works in `config.php`

### If Short Links Don't Work:
1. Verify `.htaccess` is enabled on your server
2. Check if `mod_rewrite` is enabled in Apache
3. Test direct URL: `https://reqa.antipiracyforce.org/test/redirect.php?code=test`

### If Admin Pages Show Errors:
1. Check database connection in `config.php`
2. Ensure all database tables exist (run `database.sql`)
3. Verify admin session is active (login again)
